## ‚úÖ PR Checklist

-   [ ] **ZIP layout** matches spec (legacy sizes, optional round, optional anydpi‚Äëv26 with XML).
-   [ ] **Preview grid** renders crisp at multiple sizes (no stretching).
-   [ ] **Watermark**: text, font family, **font size slider**, opacity, and **X/Y numeric** positioning all work.
-   [ ] **Safe‚Äëarea** overlay shows in preview (not in export).
-   [ ] **PWA**: generation works offline; vendors cached.
-   [ ] **CSP** compatible; no external network calls required.
-   [ ] **i18n** keys updated for labels/help text.
-   [ ] **SW `VERSION`** bumped if assets changed.
-   [ ] Docs updated (README / ZIP rules / screenshots if UI changed).

---

## üåê Adding i18n

-   Add translations in `/assets/i18n/` (e.g., `fr.json`).
-   Keep labels concise to avoid truncation.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Headers

See `/_headers` for CSP and caching. If you add external vendors, adjust CSP accordingly.

---

## üêû Good Bug Reports

Please include:

-   Minimal reproduction steps (files or logo used)
-   Expected vs actual behavior
-   Browser/OS/version
-   Console logs and screenshots where relevant
